  # Previously, the linker arguments --nmagic and -Tlink.x were set here.
  # They are now set by build.rs instead. The linker argument can still
  # only be set here, if a custom linker is needed.

  # By default, the LLD linker is used, which is shipped with the Rust
  # toolchain. If you run into problems with LLD, you can switch to the
  # GNU linker by uncommenting this line:
  # "-C", "linker=arm-none-eabi-ld",

  # If you need to link to pre-compiled C libraries provided by a C toolchain
  # use GCC as the linker by uncommenting the three lines below:

[target.thumbv6m-none-eabi]
# Pass some extra options to rustc, some of which get passed on to the linker.
#
# * linker argument --nmagic turns off page alignment of sections (which saves
#   flash space)
# * linker argument -Tlink.x tells the linker to use link.x as the linker
#   script. This is usually provided by the cortex-m-rt crate, and by default
#   the version in that crate will include a file called `memory.x` which
#   describes the particular memory layout for your specific chip. 
# * inline-threshold=5 makes the compiler more aggressive and inlining functions
# * no-vectorize-loops turns off the loop vectorizer (seeing as the M0+ doesn't
#   have SIMD)
